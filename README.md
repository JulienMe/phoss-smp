# peppol-smp-server
A complete PEPPOL SMP server. Compared to the CIPA implementation this SMP comes with a management GUI and optionally an XML backend for simplified operations.

The new layout is as follows:
  * `peppol-smp-server-library` is the base library with common features for SMP servers
  * `peppol-smp-server-sql` is the SQL backend for the SMP server
  * `peppol-smp-server-xml` is the XML backend for the SMP server
  * `peppol-smp-server-webapp` is the main SMP server web application with a management GUI and the REST service

Please read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server/wiki)** for a detailed description.
