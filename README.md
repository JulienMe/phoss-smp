# peppol-smp-server
A complete PEPPOL SMP server. Compared to the CIPA implementation this SMP comes with a management GUI and optionally an XML backend for simplified operations.

Please read the **[Wiki](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server/wiki)** for a detailed description. It contains an introduction with screenshots, configuration, building and running instructions as well as [News and noteworthy](https://github.com/phax/peppol-smp-server/wiki/News-and-noteworthy).

Latest version: **4.1.2** (2016-03-05) and **5.0.0 Beta 1** (2016-08-06)

For querying an SMP server you may want to have a look at the OSS [peppol-smp-client](https://github.com/phax/peppol-commons/).
